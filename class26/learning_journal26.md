# What I Learned


## Library and Framework !

- The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control".
 
When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you.

## WRRC (Web Request Response Cycle)

 First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.

**Client**   --- Request (Url + Verb)------------------>  **Server**

**Client**  <---Response(Message Body + Status Code)---- 


## API
An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs.It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.

It is a getway between two softwares and make them able to communicate to each other 




## What is Django ?
## Django makes it easier to build better web apps more quickly and with less code
Django is a Python-based web framework that allows you to quickly create efficient web applications. It is also called batteries included framework because Django provides built-in features for everything including Django Admin Interface, default database â€“ SQLlite3, etc. When youâ€™re building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made components to use and that too for rapid development.

***Django framework is batteries-included***
-  meaning it comes inbuilt with a lot of tools and utilities that add to the building of complex web applications. It incorporates an admin panel, user interface, testing web browsers, code editing tools, indentation, productive user interface and more.

***Django is considered somewhat opinionated*** 
- Opinionated frameworks have opinions regarding the correct way to complete certain tasks , it gives away  to build framework with best bractice .

***Django follows the Model-View-Template(MVT) design pattern***

***What is MVT?***

 MVT is a design pattern or design architecture that Django follows to develop web applications

 - The Model manages the data and is represented by a database. A model is basically a database table.
- The View receives HTTP requests and sends HTTP responses. A view interacts with a model and template to complete a response.
- The Template(HTML Page) is basically the front-end layer and the dynamic HTML component of a Django application.

## Why Django Framework ?
- Excellent documentation and high scalability.
- Used by Top MNCs and Companies, such as Instagram, Disqus, Spotify, Youtube, Bitbucket, Dropbox, etc. and the list is never-ending.
- Easiest Framework to learn, rapid development and Batteries fully included.
- The last but not least reason to learn Django is Python, Python has huge library and features such as Web Scrapping, Machine Learning, Image Processing, Scientific Computing, etc. One can integrate it all this with web application and do lots and lots of advance stuff.
