# What I Learned Today

Common terminology for a stack is Push, Pop, Peek, Swap, Copy, Duplicate and Rotate. It follows a reversed order to pop items similar to the way items are pushed. The first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

Stacks are considered as the backbone of Data Structures. Most of the algorithms and applications are implemented using stacks. The functions associated with stack are:. empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity: O(1) – Returns the size of the stack.


Python Stack is simple data structures that allow us to store and retrieve data in a sequential fashion. They are very useful in real-world cases. Having a clear understanding of stacks would help us in solving data storage problems in an efficient manner.

The Python stack is an important data structure for realizing solutions to various programming problems. As such, it is even more essential to understand the running time evaluations and working mechanism of these data structures.

Like stack, queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition – Time Complexity:. O(1) The items are pushed in the same order in which they were pushed before.

Queue in Python can be implemented by the following ways:
 

1. list
2. collections.deque
3. queue.Queue

Queue is a built-in module of Python which is used to implement a queue. It initializes a variable to a maximum size of maxsize. A maxsize of zero '0' means a infinite queue. This Queue follows FIFO rule.
