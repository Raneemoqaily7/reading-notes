# jupyterLab 
- jupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for project Jupyter.
- Free software , open standards , and web services fot interactive computing across all programming languages .
- tool give us interactive computing and weite coding , we can seperate our code line by line and get excuted seperatedly and immeditly
- development enviroument  where we can write code and the  excuted  can be seen immeditky without using python and the whole procedure  and run a special block of code immeditly and the results can be saved in notebook file and write comments in markdown .
- JupytorLab enables to work without documents and activites such as JupytorLab notebook , text editors , terminals , and custom components in a flexible , integrated , and extensible manner .

# Numpy 
- help you  to deal with big  and large of data easily
- provide the endimentional arrays (array of array of array ...)
- uded for data analysis 
- pixel : is the most smallest component of a digital image and has three valuew (rgb:Red , Green ,Blue).
- white color (255,255,255)
- black color (0,0,0)
- Numpy as array of arrays:
```
image =[
    [255,0,86],         #pixcel
    [255,255,98],       #pixcel
    [99,87,9]           #pixcel
]
```

# What is Kaggle 
**Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges**

## Numpy in Kaggle 
**The numpy library is one of the core packages in Python's data science software stack. Many other Python data analysis libraries require numpy as a prerequisite, because they use its array data structure as a building block. The Kaggle Python environment has numpy available by default**

```
second_list = [5, 6, 7, 8]

two_d_array = np.array([my_list, second_list])

print(two_d_array)
```

The "as np" after the import statement lets us access the numpy library's functions using the shorthand "np."


Create an ndarray by passing a list to np.array() function:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]             # Define a list

my_array = np.array(my_list)       # Pass the list to np.array()

type(my_array)                     # Check the object's type

numpy.ndarray
