## Big O Notation and Algorithm Analysis with Python 

Big-O notation is a metrics used to find algorithm complexity. Basically, Big-O signifies the relationship between the input to the algorithm and the steps required to execute the algorithm. It is denoted by a big "O" followed by opening and closing parenthesis.

- The following are some of the most common Big-O functions:


| Name    | Big O|
|----------|:-------------:|
|Constant|	O(c)|
|Linear|	O(n)|
|Quadratic|	O(n^2)|
|Cubic|	O(n^3)|
|Exponential|O(2^n)|
|Logarithmic|O(log(n))
|Log Linear|O(nlog(n))
