# Django CRUD and Forms

##  Working with forms

Django Forms is a web development framework that lets you define forms and their fields programmatically. Django Forms take a lot of the work out of all these steps, by letting you generate the form HTML code and handle much of the validation and user interaction.

The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit"


```
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```

The field's type attribute defines what sort of widget will be displayed. The name and id of the field are used to identify the field in JavaScript/CSS/HTML. While here we just have one text field for entering the team name, a form may have a number of such fields.

The submit input will be displayed as a button by default. This can be pressed to upload the data in all the other input elements in the form to the server (in this case, just the team_name field). The form attributes define the HTTP method used to send the data and the destination of the data on the server (action)

- action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.


- method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.
The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database, because it can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks.
The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data (for example, a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL.

## Django form handling process

Django's form handling is very similar to that we learned about in our previous Django tutorials. The main difference is that the server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and redisplay the page if there are any errors.


***The main things that Django's form handling does are:***
- Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.
The form may contain blank fields if you're creating a new record, or it may be pre-populated with initial values (for example, if you are changing a record, or have useful default initial values).
The form is referred to as unbound at this point, because it isn't associated with any user-entered data (though it may have initial values).

- Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.
Binding data to the form means that the user-entered data and any errors are available when we need to redisplay the form.

- Clean and validate the data.

1. Cleaning the data performs sanitization of the input fields, such as removing invalid characters that might be used to send malicious content to the server, and converts them into consistent Python types.

2. Validation checks that the values are appropriate for the field (for example, that they are in the right date range, aren't too short or too long, etc.)

- If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.

- If all data is valid, perform required actions (such as save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, and so on).
Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.


## Form fields

- There are many types of form fields:
 BooleanField, CharField, ChoiceField, TypedChoiceField, DateField, DateTimeField, DecimalField, DurationField, EmailField, FileField, FilePathField, FloatField, ImageField, IntegerField, GenericIPAddressField, MultipleChoiceField, TypedMultipleChoiceField, NullBooleanField, RegexField, SlugField, TimeField, URLField, UUIDField, ComboField, MultiValueField, SplitDateTimeField, ModelMultipleChoiceField, ModelChoiceField.


 - The arguments that are common to most fields are listed below (these have sensible default values):


 - required: If True, the field may not be left blank or given a None value. Fields are required by default, so you would set required=False to allow blank values in the form.
- label: The label to use when rendering the field in HTML. If a label is not specified, Django will create one from the field name by capitalizing the first letter and replacing underscores with spaces (e.g. Renewal date).
- label_suffix: By default, a colon is displayed after the label (e.g. Renewal dateâ€‹:). This argument allows you to specify a different suffix containing other character(s).
-   initial: The initial value for the field when the form is displayed.
- widget: The display widget to use.
- help_text (as seen in the example above): Additional text that can be displayed in forms to explain how to use the field.
- error_messages: A list of error messages for the field. You can override these with your own messages if needed.
- validators: A list of functions that will be called on the field when it is validated.
- localize: Enables the localization of form data input (see link for more information).
-  disabled: The field is displayed but its value cannot be edited if this is True. The default is False.
