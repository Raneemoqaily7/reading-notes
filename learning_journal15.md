# Mu Aprroaches For Today


- What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
1. I should always remember To implement and create a tree in Python, we first create a Node class that will represent a single node. The node class will have 3 variables- the left child, the second variable data containing the value for that node and the right child.

2.  We can insert any number of nodes we want inside a tree, depending upon the type of tree being created.

- What did I learn today?
A Tree is a Data structure in which data items are connected using references in a hierarchical manner. Each Tree consists of a root node from which we can access each element of the tree. Starting from the root node, each node contains zero or more nodes connected to it as children.

***binary tree***
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have a maximum of 2 children.  It means that each node in a binary tree can have either one, or two or no children. Each node in a binary tree contains data and references to its children. Both the children are named as left child and the right child according to their position. 

- What should I do differently next time?
To Solve more problem solving and practice more 

- What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
The Pre-order Traversal while traversing a tree, we see the root node for the first time and print it. It is then followed by recursion on the left and the right child
